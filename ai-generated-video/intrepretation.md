### The video is completely generated by Generative AI tools. The whole pipeline for the generation of the video is built up on 3 main pillers: Text Generation, Audio Generation, and Image/Video Generation. 

- Text Generation
    - The content/script for the video was generated by a text based LLM: ChatGPT (gpt.3.5).
    - Prompt used: <i>`Give me just a paragraph about perceptron and explain it in reference to Indian vedic systems and human cognitive aspects`</i>
    - Response generated: <i>`The perceptron, a fundamental concept in artificial intelligence and machine learning, is a simple mathematical model inspired by the functioning of a biological neuron. In the context of Indian Vedic systems and human cognitive aspects, parallels can be drawn to the interconnected nature of the perceptron's inputs and outputs, mirroring the intricate web of interdependence emphasized in Vedic philosophy. Much like the Vedic notion of the interconnectedness of all things, perceptrons utilize input signals to produce an output, highlighting the importance of information integration in both systems. Additionally, the perceptron's ability to learn from experience through adjustable weights reflects the adaptability inherent in human cognition, echoing the Vedic emphasis on the evolution of consciousness and self-realization. While the mechanistic nature of perceptrons contrasts with the spiritual depth of Vedic thought, the intersection of these concepts underscores the diverse sources of inspiration shaping our understanding of intelligence and cognition.`</i>

- Audio Generation
    - The audio of Professor Gopinath was taken from one of his lectures form the Youtube: [Video](https://youtu.be/4ZkNnR--tMY)
    - This video was converted to a `wav` file and was enhanced by [Adobe Poscast](https://podcast.adobe.com/)
    - Then we used [PlayHT](https://play.ht/voice-cloning/) to clone the voice and used the script generated by the response form previous text generation.
    - We had the audio generated [here](/ai-generated-video/cloned_voice.wav)

- Video Generation
    - The video is generated by [InVideo](https://invideo.io/studio)
    - The script generated by the text generation was used as the script to generate the video here.
    - Some manual tweaking was needed for the right image selection in the video.
    - Then the video was edited with the proper audio that was generated by the previous audio generative tool.

### Conclusion
Overall this enire pipeline took around 30-40 minutes to complete. There were some complications such as the audio not generating the exact punctuation and the speed of the video. Also some of the images in the video generation part do not maintain the context of the script.
